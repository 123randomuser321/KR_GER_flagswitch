Hello reader!

This document is just a quick rundown on sources plus some general notes.

General notes:

As of now, this mod does three things:

1. It overwrites the standard German flag in Kaiserreich with the tricolour.
2. It creates one cosmetic tags (for the war flag) to use.
3. It uses two events to switch between the flags, depending on your diplomatic state (i.e. at war --> War flag; at peace --> Civil flag), plus a third event to reset things.


Files overwritten:

[Kaiserreich]/gfx/flags/GER.tga
[Kaiserreich]/gfx/flags/medium/GER.tga
[Kaiserreich]/gfx/flags/small/GER.tga


Files added:

Dev notes:


I did this, because I am bothered with seeing the Reichskriegsflagge (english: Imperial War Flag) during peacetime.
While simple replacers already exist, I couldn't find a mod that actually switches the flags depending on your diplomatic state.
So I did this. If anyone already did that: sorry, didn't find your mod.

As of now, this mod has cosmetic tags for Germany in general, disregarding ideologies.
Although that shouldn't be a problem (since you are not supposed to puppet GER, with the exception of RUS, but they usually do not have non-logical ideologies regarding the German Empire), bear in mind, that this mod will, in such cases, give GER non-logical flags.
