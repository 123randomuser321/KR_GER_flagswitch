Hello reader!

This document is just a quick rundown on sources plus some general notes.


Sources:

General notes:

As of now, this mod does three things:

1. It overwrites the standard German flag in Kaiserreich with the tricolour.
2. It creates two cosmetic tags (the flags) to use.
3. It uses two events to switch between the flags, depending on your diplomatic state (i.e. at war --> War flag; at peace --> Civil flag).


Files overridden:

[Kaiserreich]/gfx/flags/GER.tga

Dev notes:

This mod took me way too long to make.

(small flag sizes 11x7 only works in KR, 10x7 is still the vanilla dimension)


I did this, because I am bothered with seeing the Reichskriegsflagge (english: Imperial War Flag) during peacetime.
While simple replacers already exist, I couldn't find a mod that actually switches the flags depending on your diplomatic state.
So I did this. If anyone already did that: sorry, didn't find your mod.

I might rework the events at some point, but as of now, everything should work.

As of now, this mod has cosmetic tags for Germany in general, disregarding ideologies.
Although that shouldn't be a problem (since you are not supposed to puppet GER, with the exception of RUS, but they usually do not have non-logical ideologies regarding the German Empire), bear in mind, that this mod will, in such cases, give GER non-logical flags.
